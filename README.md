This is a fork that was needed because the original maintainer stopped publishing it to npm. See [issue](https://github.com/fullstackreact/google-maps-react/issues/536).
He updated the repository to allow React 18, which is what we need, but he did not publish it. As such, I tried pointing to it, but we also needed the compiled `dist/` folder to make that work. Hence, the need for this fork and the commit adding that folder to master here.
